##TMUX

> tmux is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the Unix shell that started the program. It provides much of the same functionality as GNU Screen, but is distributed under a BSD license.

tmux 是 GNU screen 的 wrapper.

我自己将其`bind-key`映射为 `C-q`，而不是 `C-a`的原因是在shell下会使用Emacs的`C-a`.

常用操作：

- `tmux new-session -s <name>`, 我在bashrc中映射为 `t`
- `C-q d`, detach session
- `C-q a`, attach session
- `C-q %`, split vertically
- `C-q [`, enter copy mode
- `C-q ]`, paster buffer
- `C-q c`, create new window
- `C-q ,`, rename window
